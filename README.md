# rust-ImGui-glue
This project serves as a template to start a GUI project in rust using ImGui with c++

When building this project, it downloads the newest version of the c++ library Dear ImGui using the docking branch and keeps it up to date.

This template implements a modified example provided by Dear ImGui. Change the function define_guis() defined in ./src/gui/gui_lib.cpp to define your own GUI.
